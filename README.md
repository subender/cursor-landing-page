## 🛠 Sections Recreated
I have meticulously recreated the following sections to match the original design:
* **Navigation Bar:** A sleek, blurred-background sticky header with responsive links and CTA buttons.
* **Hero Section:** Replicated the bold typography, the central "AI-powered" messaging.
* **Feature Showcase:** A grid-based layout displaying the core features of the editor with custom-styled cards.
* **Footer:** A clean, multi-column footer layout containing navigation links and social icons.
